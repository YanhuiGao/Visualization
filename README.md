### CST2106 Tableau Group Project:
## Ethnocultural diversity and immigration analysis based on 2016 Census of Canada

#### Thanks to the diverse culture and embracing environment, Canada has become one of the most popular countries attracting more immigrants. Immigrants and their descendants are not only contributing to the social and economic development of the country, but also playing a significant role in shaping and enriching the ethnic, cultural and linguistic composition of the Canadian population. (Statistics Canada, 2017)
##### There were 7 datasets and 4 joins used in the project.
